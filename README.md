I completed a project where I created a clone of the Sidcup Family Golf website using HTML and CSS, aimed at enhancing my web development skills through hands-on practice. This project, built with a focus on
replicating the design and functionality of the Sidcup Family Golf website, includes several key features that contribute to a comprehensive user experience. The homepage is designed with a clean and elegant layout, 
featuring a responsive navigation menu that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility on both desktop and mobile devices. The website includes a visually appealing photo gallery that 
showcases various golf courses and events, organized using CSS Grid to create a neat and structured presentation.
